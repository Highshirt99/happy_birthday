                    all the job and bucks I made through it.

Happy birthday Arike. I bless

Through the good, bad and ugly, 
i can always rest in the assurance that

 i don't take for granted.
Baby, you are all shades of amazing.
 Your tenacity, how you love wholeheartedly
 and still stay true to yourself are traits
  worthy of emulation. I'm glad i have front
   row seats

 Cheers to a million more years of friendship.
This year, God continues to show up for you. Shouts of joy will never cease in your mouth. That which you desire the most, He will grant you. I pray you never lose your wonder. Many happy returns. I LOVE YOU.
